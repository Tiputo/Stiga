# Project Stiga
A fun website that allows to add players and write match scores through administration and send it to the website with a score system :)

The scoring system does not depend on the number of games but on a player success.
- Used Headless CMS [Contember](https://www.contember.com/), frameworks react.js and next.js, written in TypeScript and JavaScript
